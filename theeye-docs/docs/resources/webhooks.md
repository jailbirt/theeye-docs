#### Webhooks

A webhook can be used to perform an action when an event occurs on other website. When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook.

To create a webhook \(incoming webhook\), just go to the _Webhooks_ section left menu, and click on "_+ new Incoming webhook_". Name it and save it. Once you have saved it, expand it, by clicking over the webhook box, you'll be able to see the URL assigned to the webhook.

The webhook you created can be used as a trigger for other resources \(e.g. You can set the webhook to be the trigger of a task\) as shown hereunder.

### Workflow

Workflow connects your tasks together to automate complex or dependent processes.

Which trigger would you like to use? You can start a workflow directly with a play button or you can use monitors or tasks as triggers.

Check the [Workflow Documentation](workflows/) for more details.
