A _**resource**_ is an open concept on the **The Eye**. If you head to the web UI they are the first thing you'll see, they are whatever can report a status and for that, as this concept, they deserve the main view of the UI dashboard. Basically every _**resource**_ is a _**monitor**_ watching things out for you.

Take a _**host**_ for example: its status is unknown and unmeasurable. Only when a _**host monitor**_ is assigned to it, and starts reporting it's status and health, the _**host**_ becomes a reliable, accountable _**resource**_.

A _**web scrapper**_ is a way of monitoring an external websites or APIs, can report a status and, if needed, _**trigger**_ _**tasks**_ or _**workflows**_. It's an accountable _**resource**_ signaling _**monitor events**_.

As you can see, the _**resource**_ concept points to be any source of information \(thus, decision\) on your infrastructure. Complex and dependent processes can be setup though _**resources**_ and, as well as it may sound confusing first, it becomes more and more as a comfortable concept for it's defined functionality and schema.
