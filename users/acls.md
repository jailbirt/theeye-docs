# ACLs

In the previous section we've described user roles and administration. ACLs applies directly to resources.
Admin roles can make resources visible to other members by adding them to the input field labeled _ACL's_ available on _Tasks_ and _Monitors_. When a user is added to an ACL list, then the resource becomes available and accesible according to the member's role. Notifications are sent to all users within the ACL list, regardless the user role. E-mail addresses can also be added to ACLs lists in order to have them notified disregarding any account membership.
