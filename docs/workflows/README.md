## Workflow Execution

Workflows are launched in the same way tasks are. Each time a workflow is launched a new job is created. The selected starting task, will be executed when a workflow is triggered. In this example the Workflow "Expense Management" is started:

## Workflow Creation

As workflows conects tasks, tasks must be designed and created in advance in order to use them in workflows. Arguments are passed through tasks on each workflow job \(execution\)_._

In this video 3 tasks are conected to create "Expense Management" workflow:  

1. Start Expense Approval Process  \(Input task\)
   * Receives a _text_, a _file_ and a _date._
2. Approve Expense \(Approval task\)
   * Expects a _text,_ a _file_ and a _date._
   * Sends a _text,_ a _file_ and a _date_.
3. Expense submission \(Script task\)
   * Receives a _text_ a _file_ and a _date._
