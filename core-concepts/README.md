# Core Concepts

## Introduction

**The Eye** is an _automation platform_. It can be both an _automation platform as a service_ or an _automation service platform,_ depending on your use case. It allows you to **monitor** and manage **resources**, launch and **schedule** **tasks**, write and/or upload **scripts**, build **workflows** through a series of **task** results or even **trigger** specific **tasks** or **workflows** as response to one of your **monitors**. All this is done from a web interface and a mobile app.

The **bolded keywords** in the above paragraph are all core concepts of The Eye.
