# Getting started

#### First Steps

To start using TheEye you will need to:

1. Have a user account. If you don't have one go to [https://theeye.io/register](https://theeye.io/register) and create one.
2. Install an [Agent](../the-eye-agent/installation.md) on each server you would like to perform actions or automate from.
3. Create your first resource from TheEye Web.

Once you've activated your user account, you'll see this Dashboard after login:

An onboarding tutorial will guide you through the install process of an [Agent](../the-eye-agent/installation.md) and create a task.

In case you don't want to follow the tutorial, you can install the agents on your own following instructions from Settings-&gt;Installer in the side menu. Detailed [installation instructions is available here](../the-eye-agent)
