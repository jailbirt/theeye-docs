# Agent installation

The first time you access The Eye web UI you'll see a link in the monitors panel:

> Click __HERE__ to get the step by step instructions to install the Agent on Linux and Windows operating systems

Click on it and follow the on screen instructions.

You can always go to _Settings_ in the left menu and head to the _Installation_ section. Installation instructions are provided for Linux and Windows systems.

* Linux:

![linux install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGastrell/theeye-docs/master/images/LinuxAgentInstall.jpg)

* Windows:

![windows install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGastrell/theeye-docs/master/images/WindowsAgentInstall.jpg)

* Docker

After each [Agent](../the-eye-agent) is installed a new [resource](../core-concepts/resources.md) will show up in the Dashboard.

For detailed installation information check the [agent installation instructions](../the-eye-agent/installation.md)
