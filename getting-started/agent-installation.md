# Agent installation

The first time you access The Eye web UI you'll see a link in the monitors panel:

Click on it and follow the on screen instructions.

You can always go to _Settings_ in the left menu and head to the _Installation_ section. Installation instructions are provided for Linux and Windows systems.

After each [Agent](../the-eye-agent/) is installed a new [resource]() will show up in the Dashboard.
