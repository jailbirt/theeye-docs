### Create Template

Templates are based on Tasks and Monitors that run on Bots and are therefore applied to Bots. When creating a template you will need to identify the Bot you would like to start from \(the one that is asigned to the tasks and monitors you would like to reuse\). 

Click on "+ New Bot Template"
